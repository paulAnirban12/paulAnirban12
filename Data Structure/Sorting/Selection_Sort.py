# 1.Find the Minimum Element – Search the entire list for the smallest element.

# 2.Swap It with the First Unsorted Element – Place it at the beginning of the unsorted section.

# 3.Repeat for the Remaining Elements – Continue this process, ignoring the already sorted section.
# Example
# Unsorted List:
# [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

# Pass 1:
# Find the smallest element → 2

# Swap 2 with the first element (5)

# List after swap: [2, 3, 8, 4, 5]

# Pass 2:
# Find the smallest in remaining → 3

# Swap 3 with itself (no change)

# List remains: [2, 3, 8, 4, 5]

# Pass 3:
# Find the smallest in remaining → 4

# Swap 4 with 8

# List after swap: [2, 3, 4, 8, 5]

# Pass 4:
# Find the smallest in remaining → 5

# Swap 5 with 8

# List after swap: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

# ✅ Sorted List: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
# Best, Worst & Average Case: O(n²)
