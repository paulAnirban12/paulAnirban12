# 1.Start at the Beginning – Compare the first two elements.

# 2.Swap if Necessary – If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.

# 3.Move to the Next Pair – Continue comparing and swapping adjacent elements until the largest element reaches the end (like a bubble floating up).

# 4.Repeat for Remaining Elements – Ignore the last sorted element and repeat the process until all elements are sorted.
# Example
# Unsorted List:
# [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

# Pass 1:
# Compare 5 & 3 → Swap → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]

# Compare 5 & 8 → No Swap → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]

# Compare 8 & 4 → Swap → [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]

# Compare 8 & 2 → Swap → [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
# (Largest element 8 is now at the end)

# Pass 2:
# Compare 3 & 5 → No Swap → [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]

# Compare 5 & 4 → Swap → [3, 4, 5, 2, 8]

# Compare 5 & 2 → Swap → [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
# (Second largest element 5 is now in place)

# Pass 3:
# Compare 3 & 4 → No Swap → [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]

# Compare 4 & 2 → Swap → [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]

# Pass 4:
# Compare 3 & 2 → Swap → [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

# ✅ Sorted List: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
# Best Case = O(n)
# Worst/Average Case = O(n²)
